  8   Info  GLO-51     Hierarchical instance automatically ungrouped.     
                       Hierarchical instances can be automatically        
                       ungrouped to allow for better area or timing       
                       optimization. You can control auto ungrouping      
                       using the root-level attribute 'auto_ungroup'.     
                       You can skip individual instances or modules       
                       using the attribute 'ungroup_ok'.                  
 10   Info  LBR-155    Mismatch in unateness between 'timing_sense'       
                       attribute and the function.                        
                       The 'timing_sense' attribute will be respected.    
  1   Info  LBR-161    Setting the maximum print count of this message    
                       to 10 if information_level is less than 9.         
 20   Info  LBR-162    Both 'pos_unate' and 'neg_unate' timing_sense      
                       arcs have been processed.                          
                       Setting the 'timing_sense' to non_unate.           
 20 Warning LBR-22     Multiply-defined library cell.                     
                       Library cell names must be unique.  Any            
                       duplicates will be deleted.  Only the first (as    
                       determined by the order of libraries) will be      
                       retained.                                          
  1 Warning LBR-38     Libraries have inconsistent nominal operating      
                       conditions.                                        
                       This is a common source of delay calculation       
                       confusion and is strongly discouraged.             
  2   Info  LBR-41     An output library pin lacks a function attribute.  
                       If the remainder of this library cell's semantic   
                       checks are successful, it will be considered as a  
                       timing-model (because one of its outputs does not  
                       have a valid function.                             
  2   Info  LBR-412    Created nominal operating condition.               
                       The nominal operating condition represents either  
                       the nominal PVT values if specified in the         
                       library source, or the default PVT values (1.0,    
                       1.0, 1.0).                                         
  2   Info  LBR-518    Missing a function attribute in the output pin     
                       definition.                                        
 20 Warning LBR-9      Library cell has no output pins defined.           
                       Add the missing output pin(s), then reload the     
                       library. Otherwise, the library cell will be       
                       marked as unusable and as timing model.            
  2   Info  PHYS-752   Partition Based Synthesis execution skipped.       
  2   Info  POPT-51    Could not declone clock-gating instances.          
                       The design should have 2 or more clock-gating      
                       instances for decloning.                           
  3 Warning RPT_DP-100 The filename, column and line number information   
                       will not be available in the report.               
                       You must set the 'hdl_track_filename_row_col'      
                       attribute to 'true' (before elaborate) to enable   
                       filename, column, and line number tracking in the  
                       datapath report.                                   
  2  Error  SDC-202    Could not interpret SDC command.                   
                       The 'read_sdc' command encountered a problem       
                       while trying to evaluate an SDC command. This SDC  
                       command will be added to the Tcl variable          
                       $::dc::sdc_failed_commands.                        
  1  Error  SDC-203    Option missing for SDC command.                    
                       This SDC command requires the indicated options.   
                       Check the SDC command and contact Cadence          
                       customer support if you believe this option        
                       combination should be supported.                   
  2 Warning SDC-208    Could not find requested search value.             
                       Use the 'vcd' and 'vls' commands to browse the     
                       virtual directories to find the object because     
                       the specified name and/or location does not exist. 
  1 Warning SDC-209    One or more commands failed when these             
                       constraints were applied.                          
                       You can examine the failed commands or save them   
                       to a file by querying the Tcl variable             
                       $::dc::sdc_failed_commands.

  9 Warning TIM-11     Possible timing problems have been detected in     
                       this design.                                       
                       Use 'report timing -lint' for more information.    
  1   Info  TIM-167    An external clock is being defined.                
                       An external clock does not directly drive any      
                       points within the design, but is only used as a    
                       reference for external delays.                     
  1  Error  TUI-10     No designs are available. A design must first be   
                       read in and elaborated.                            
                       A design must first be read in with 'read_hdl'     
                       command and elaborated with 'elaborate' command.   
128   Info  TUI-58     Removed object.                                    
  1  Error  TUI-61     A required object parameter could not be found.    
                       Check to make sure that the object exists and is   
                       of the correct type.  The 'what_is' command can    
                       be used to determine the type of an object.
